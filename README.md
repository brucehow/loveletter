Love Letter is a card game for 2-4 players. The goal for each player is to get their love letter to the princess by passing it to an intermediary, or directly to the princess. Each player has only 1 card in their hand at a time but draw an additional card on their turn. Players can choose to play between one of the two cards on their turn, each of which have a different action that will affect the state of the game in itâ€™s own way. Without knowing the hands of every player and cards remaining in the deck, we can understand intuitively the difficulty for one to determine the most optimal play at any stage in the game.
